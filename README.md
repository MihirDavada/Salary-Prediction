**Salary Prediction - Regression Problem**

**Project Overview:**
The Salary Prediction project is designed to predict salary figures based on various features and data collected from Glassdoor through web scraping. It encompasses data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model building.

**Data Collection:**
Utilize web scraping techniques and Selenium tools to gather salary-related data from Glassdoor, including job listings, job titles, location, experience requirements, and corresponding salaries.

**Data Cleaning:**
Employ NumPy and Pandas to clean and preprocess the collected data. This includes handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Utilize NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform in-depth data analysis. Explore relationships between features, visualize data distributions, and gain insights into factors influencing salary levels.

**Model Building:**
Employ machine learning regression techniques to build predictive models. Experiment with various algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to forecast salaries effectively.
The project's objective is to create a robust model capable of accurately predicting salaries based on job-related features. By utilizing data scraping and advanced data analysis techniques, we aim to provide valuable insights into salary trends and facilitate data-driven decision-making in the job market.
